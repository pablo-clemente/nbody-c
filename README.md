# nbody-c
N-body simulation implemented in C and using MPI 

# Alpha Centauri Orbit Simulation
We aim to compare the runtime for Alpha Centauri binary star system orbit simulation using the N-body model previously performed in Python now using C.

# Alpha Centauri
Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to the Sun, located at a distance of just 4.37 light years or 1.34 parsecs from Earth. The system consists of Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B. It is sometimes known as Alpha Centauri AB (Î± Cen AB).
